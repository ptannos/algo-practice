/* NODE DEPTHS

The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root
is caled the node's depth. Write a function that takes in a binary
tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depths. 

Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a
right child node. Children nodes can either be BoinaryTree nodes
themselves or None / null. */
